Nonetheless, convolutional layers contain massive parameters, which restrict the deployment of CNNs on satellite and airborne platforms with limited storage and computing resources. In this letter, we propose a lightweight spectral-spatial convolution module (LS2CM) as an alternative to convolutional layer. The proposed LS2CM can greatly reduce network parameters and computational complexity in terms of multiplyaccumulate operations (MACs) while still maintaining or even improving classification performance. Furthermore, it is a plugand- play component and can be used to upgrade existing CNNbased models for HSI classification. Experimental results on two benchmark HSI data sets demonstrate that the proposed LS2CM achieves competitive results in comparison with other state-ofthe- art methods.","tags":null,"title":"A lightweight spectral-spatial convolution module for hyperspectral image classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhe Meng***, Licheng Jiao, Miaomiao Liang, et al."],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic's Markdown slides feature.

However, CNN models usually generate a large number of feature maps, which lead to high redundancy and cannot guarantee to effectively extract discriminative features for well characterizing the complex structures of HSIs. In this paper, two novel mixed link networks (MLNets) are proposed to enhance the representational ability of CNNs for HSI classification. Specifically, the proposed mixed link architectures integrate the feature re-usage property of the residual network and the capability of effective new feature exploration of the densely convolutional network, extracting more discriminative features from HSIs. Compared with the dual path architecture, the proposed mixed link architectures can further improve the information flow throughout the network.

However, most CNN based methods used in HSI classification neglect adequately utilizing the strong complementary yet correlated information from each convolutional layer and only employ the last convolutional layer features for classification. In this paper, we propose a novel fully dense multiscale fusion network (FDMFN) that takes full advantage of the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers for HSI classification. In the proposed network, shortcut connections are introduced between any two layers in a feed-forward manner, enabling features learned by each layer to be accessed by all subsequent layers. This fully dense connectivity pattern achieves comprehensive feature reuse and enforces discriminative feature learning. In addition, various spectral-spatial features with multiple scales from all convolutional layers are fused to extract more discriminative features for HSI classification. Experimental results on three widely used hyperspectral scenes demonstrate that the proposed FDMFN can achieve better classification performance in comparison with several state-of-the-art approaches.","tags":null,"title":"Fully dense multiscale fusion network for hyperspectral image classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhe Meng**, Lingling Li*, Xu Tang, et al."],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic's Markdown slides feature.

In this work, a novel CNN model is proposed, which is wider than other existing deep learning-based HSI classification models. Based on the fact that very deep residual networks (ResNets) behave like ensembles of relatively shallow networks, our proposed network, called multipath ResNet (MPRN), employs multiple residual functions in the residual blocks to make the network wider, rather than deeper. The proposed network consists of shorter-medium paths for efficient gradient flow and replaces the stacking of multiple residual blocks in ResNet with fewer residual blocks but more parallel residual functions in each of it.

In this paper, we propose a new superpixel-based relational auto-encoder for cohesive spectral–spatial feature learning. Firstly, multiscale local spatial information and global semantic features of hyperspectral images are extracted by filter banks transferred from the pre-trained VGG-16. Meanwhile, we utilize superpixel segmentation to construct the low-dimensional manifold embedded in the spectral domain. Then, representational consistency constraint among each superpixel is added in the objective function of sparse auto-encoder, which iteratively assist and supervisedly learn hidden representation of deep spatial feature with greater cohesiveness. Superpixel-based local consistency constraint in this work not only reduces the computational complexity, but builds the neighborhood relationships adaptively. The final feature extraction is accomplished by collaborative encoder of spectral–spatial feature and weighting fusion of multiscale features. A large number of experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves expected results in discriminant feature extraction and has certain advantages over some existing methods, especially on extremely limited sample conditions.","tags":null,"title":"A superpixel-based relational auto-encoder for feature extraction of hyperspectral images","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.
